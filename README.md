This is a repository to work with and create a NFT Marketplace in a javascript environment using hardhat.
This is a backend repository, it also work with a [frontend repository](https://github.com/jrmunchkin/nft-marketplace-front-end). However you absolutly can use this repository without the frontend part.

## Summary

## Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/jrmunchkin/nft-marketplace
cd nft-marketplace
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Testnet Development

If you want to be able to deploy to testnets, do the following. I suggest to use goerli network.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set your `GOERLI_RPC_URL`, and `PRIVATE_KEY`

You can get a `GOERLI_RPC_URL` by opening an account at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). Follow the steps to create a new application.

You also can work with [Infura](https://infura.io/).

You can find your `PRIVATE_KEY` from your ethereum wallet like [metamask](https://metamask.io/).

To be able to fully use the NFT collections you will need an account on [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/). It will help you to push your NFTs metadata on IPFS and create a pin for you. To use Pinata you will need an `PINATA_API_KEY`, a `PINATA_API_SECRET` and a `PINATA_JWT` that you can find in the developers section. Additionally use `UPLOAD_TO_PINATA` to push conditionally on pinata.

If you want to use it with the [frontend repository](https://github.com/jrmunchkin/nft-marketplace-front-end), You also can clone it and set your frontend path `FRONT_END_FOLDER`

the `UPDATE_FRONT_END` set to true will update your frontend with the last deployed contract.

Finally you can add a `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` if you want to use hardhat gas reporter. You can find one by registring to [CoinMarketCap Developers](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/).

You can add your environment variables to the `.env` file:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
GOERLI_RPC_URL=<RPC_URL>
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
FRONT_END_FOLDER=<YOUR_PATH_TO_FRONTEND>
UPDATE_FRONT_END=<TRUE_OR_FALSE>
PINATA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
PINATA_API_SECRET=<YOUR_API_SECRET>
PINATA_JWT=<YOUR_JWT>
UPLOAD_TO_PINATA=<TRUE_OR_FALSE>
```

You'll also need testnet goerli ETH if you want to deploy on goerli tesnet. You can get ETH into your wallet by using the [alchemy goerli faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/) or [chainlink faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/).

# Usage

## Deployment

Feel free to change the mintFee variable in the helper-hardhat-config.js for setting your mint fee for the NFT collections.

To deploy the contracts locally

```bash
yarn hardhat deploy
```

To deploy on goerli tesnet you need to create first a subscription on [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link/goerli).
Add the newly created subscriptionId to your helper-hardhat-config.js.

To deploy the contracts on goerli tesnet

```bash
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli
```

Once the contracts are deployed on goerli, you need to add them as a consumer to your subscription (Don't forget to claim some LINK by using the [chainlink faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/)).

To update the front end repository with the newly deployed contracts (You need to pull the [frontend](https://github.com/jrmunchkin/nft-marketplace-front-end) and set your `FRONT_END_FOLDER` first)

```bash
yarn hardhat deploy --tags frontend
```

## Testing

For unit testing

```
yarn hardhat test
```

For integration testing

```
yarn hardhat test --network goerli
```
